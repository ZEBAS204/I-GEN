## Why I-GEN?

I-GEN (a combination of the word "idea" and "generator") is an open-source application designed to help artists improve their skills by providing them with a diverse set of words to practice with.

The main focus of this project is not reinventing the wheel. Instead, I-GEN aims to address the common issues you may face while surfing the web in search of a tool like this one, such as:

- A limited set of words
- Weird shenanigans just to get two words
- Can not combine two languages simultaneously
- Have to visit or refresh a page just to get new words
- Most of the tools available are focused in one language (English mostly)

I-GEN is licensed under the MIT license (MIT). But as this project uses content extracted using [Wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract) from the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://www.wikimedia.org), may differ on licenses. See the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file for more details.

## Attributions

**Terminology:** The set of two files containing words, in this case, adjectives and nouns from a given language are called "wordsets".

Some old versions of this application used English wordsets that were extracted from [WordNet's Electronic Lexical Database](https://wordnet.princeton.edu):

## Previous versions

To this date, previous versions made before the release are still usable to anyone. The main idea of keeping these previous versions is to show progress and improvements over them, as this project was originally made to learn React.

If you wish to see by yourself any of these previous versions, please refer to their following branches BUT, expect issues, unresponsiveness, performance problems, visual glitches, incomplete features, no words nor translations, and bugs:

- [V1 branch](/tree/v1) -> [V1 APP]()
- [V2 branch](/tree/v2) -> [V2 APP]()
- The V3 branch is currently the `master` branch
